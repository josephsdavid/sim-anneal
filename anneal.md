# Simulated Annealing

## What is annealing?

Annealing is the process in which we heat a metal to incredibly high temperatures in order to **break down its fine crystal structure**.
We then cool the metal at a proper rate which allows us to reform the crystal structure to be **optimally** suited to our use case

The boltzmann distribution:

$$f(E) = e^{\frac{E}{kT}}$$
